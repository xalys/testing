CHANGELOG
=========

A [BC BREAK] means the update will break the project for many reasons:

* new mandatory configuration
* new dependencies
* class refactoring
* renaming

### 0.2-dev

* [BC BREAK] use translatable keys instead of plain text
* [BC BREAK] change file extensions from `*.xlf` to `*.xliff`
